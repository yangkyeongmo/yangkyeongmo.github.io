Have you seen the movie "*Snowpiercer*"? Snowpiercer is a perfectly designed train, designed to survive an eternal winter. A dream of every engineer. However, just like perpetual engine cannot exist in real world, nothing is permanent. After a while some parts went extinct. Extinction wasn't a concept applied to animals to people of Snowpiercer. Without engineers who can design and materials to be built with, extinction could be applied to stone cold objects too. In this harsh situation, something, or *someone*, has to deal with the problem. Since the ancient, ancient past such as stone age, manual labor has solved many problems. It applied to them too. This time, the solution was to send a kid down a box-sized container below an engine room.

We, software engineer, frequently meet situations like this. Most companies start small. So they don't start with all shiny tools and methods. But some of the fortunate companies are gifted with brilliant people. We could imagine an ideal world where everyone solves every problem with well-oiled, hard-discussed, automated and scrutinized-to-the-end way, even if it takes some resources. But, well, it's really "ideal". Most of the time companies just don't have the resource to do that. Sometimes companies have to push workers to deal with problems manually. If problems are not addressed in the right time, some manual works are left as remnants of the ugly past, making someone have to take the key. Then, the glorious "engine room kid" is born. Without them, company work is delayed.

Taking the role as this kid could give a honored feeling to themselves. Think about it. The company might be in severe pain without you! Doesn't that make you feel very important? That's C-level-ish importance to the company, even if you aren't that level. Since you're like sacrificing your life to do manual work, it almost feels sacred doing the thing. However, it shouldn't be taken as glory.

Not many things aren't at least semi-perpetual in real world and so is any industry. Let's get back to the Snowpiercer story. The kid eventually gets bigger as he grows. As his limbs and his torso grow, his body won't fit into the confined box anymore. Worse part is the kid won't have anywhere to go even if he gets out of the box. Does he have skills to live by himself? No. (Well, at least he'll be like prodigy at using spanner or else though,) No social skills, just a sad, sad underdevelopment. Taking ego to enjoy keep doing the manual work is like that. Being this "engine room kid" is hard to be beneficial to oneself, and the work itself eventually becomes legacy too.

Ego is one of the biggest enemy to self development. It might make you like your sacred manual work. Worse part is it might blind you from moving away. But fortunately, I think this industry has already introduced the best practice for this situation. If someone is blind, another person can be their eye. We already know some methods to have a look at what others are doing. Do periodic stand-up, have some coffee chat, and do some bi-weekly retrospective meeting. Solving their problem and relieving from their labor would be the best, but we don't usually expect others to do that in business situation. Just poking the person to tell the truth you see might change their view. Be like Kurtis if you can. Save the kid, but expect some tradeoffs. But if you can't, that fine. Just tell them they don't have to be there.

Things doesn't get scary until *you*'re asked to become the engine room kid. Since the engine must keep rolling, or in other words the show must go on, someone must take the key. When that happens and no one has prepared for it, same situation goes on and on. You don't have to do that.
